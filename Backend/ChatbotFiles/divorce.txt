Sri Lankan Divorce Laws and Procedure (General Law) - As of April 10, 2025

Overview of Divorce Laws in Sri Lanka
-------------------------------------
In Sri Lanka, divorce laws depend on the legal system applicable to the marriage. This document focuses on the General Law under the Marriage Registration Ordinance No. 19 of 1907, which applies to most Sri Lankans (e.g., Sinhalese not under Kandyan Law, Tamils, Christians, etc.). Divorce under this law is fault-based, requiring proof of a matrimonial fault by one spouse. Note: Proposed reforms in 2024 to introduce no-fault divorce are not yet enacted as of April 10, 2025.

Grounds for Divorce (Fault-Based)
--------------------------------
1. Adultery: Sexual intercourse with someone other than the spouse after marriage. Requires strong evidence (beyond reasonable doubt), though circumstantial evidence is often accepted.
2. Malicious Desertion:
   - Simple Malicious Desertion: The at-fault spouse abandons the matrimonial home with intent to end the marriage.
   - Constructive Malicious Desertion: The innocent spouse is forced to leave due to the other’s intolerable behavior.
3. Incurable Impotency at the Time of Marriage: The spouse was incurably impotent when the marriage was contracted, preventing consummation.

What to Do in a Divorce Situation
--------------------------------
1. Assess Your Situation:
   - Identify which ground(s) apply to your case (adultery, desertion, or impotency).
   - Determine if you’re the plaintiff (filing for divorce) or defendant (responding to a filing).

2. Consult a Lawyer:
   - Hire a qualified Sri Lankan attorney specializing in family law. They will guide you through the process, draft legal documents, and represent you in court.
   - Discuss your evidence and strategy, as fault must be proven in court.

3. Gather Required Documents (See Below):
   - Collect all necessary paperwork to support your case and meet court requirements.

4. File the Divorce Case:
   - Your lawyer will file a Plaint in the District Court with jurisdiction over your or your spouse’s domicile (at least one must be domiciled in Sri Lanka).
   - The Plaint outlines the matrimonial fault and relief sought (e.g., divorce, custody, alimony).

5. Serve Summons:
   - The court will issue summons to the defendant (your spouse), who must respond. If they’re abroad, this may involve the Sri Lankan Embassy in that country.

6. Court Proceedings:
   - Uncontested Divorce: If the defendant agrees to the divorce, the process is faster. The court issues a Decree Nisi (temporary divorce order), which becomes absolute after 3 months.
   - Contested Divorce: If the defendant disputes the claims, a trial occurs. You’ll need to present evidence (witnesses, documents, etc.) to prove fault. This can take years, especially if custody or finances are disputed.

7. Post-Divorce Matters:
   - Address custody (court prioritizes the child’s best interests, often favoring the father unless unfit), child maintenance, and alimony (discretionary, based on need and means).
   - Await the Decree Absolute to finalize the divorce.

Required Documents
------------------
1. Original Marriage Certificate (or Certified Copy):
   - Obtain from the Registrar of Marriages where the marriage was registered.
2. Certified Copies of Children’s Birth Certificates (if applicable):
   - Needed if seeking custody or maintenance for children.
3. Evidence of Matrimonial Fault:
   - Adultery: Witness statements, photos, messages, or other circumstantial evidence.
   - Desertion: Proof of abandonment (e.g., affidavits, utility bills showing separate residences) or intolerable conduct (e.g., police reports for abuse).
   - Impotency: Medical reports from the time of marriage.
4. Timeline of Events:
   - A detailed chronology of the marriage breakdown, prepared with your lawyer.
5. Proxy (Power of Attorney):
   - If you’re abroad or unable to appear, sign a proxy appointing your lawyer to act on your behalf (prepared by your lawyer).
6. Addresses:
   - Current addresses of both spouses in Sri Lanka (for jurisdiction and summons).

Additional Notes
----------------
- Jurisdiction: At least one spouse must be domiciled in Sri Lanka (have a permanent address there).
- Timeframe: Uncontested divorces take 6 months to 1 year (including the 3-month Decree Nisi period). Contested cases can take several years.
- If Abroad: You can file through a power of attorney holder (e.g., a friend or lawyer in Sri Lanka). Coordinate with the Sri Lankan Embassy for summons if the defendant is overseas.
- Proposed Reforms: A no-fault divorce law is under consideration (as of July 2024 announcements), but not yet in effect. Check with your lawyer for updates.

Recommendation
--------------
Divorce in Sri Lanka can be complex and emotionally taxing, especially in contested cases. Engage a reputable lawyer early, gather strong evidence, and be prepared for a potentially lengthy process if disputed. For the latest legal status (e.g., no-fault divorce enactment), consult a legal professional in Sri Lanka.
