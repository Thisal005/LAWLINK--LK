Sri Lanka Legal System Overview
Sri Lanka’s legal system is a distinctive fusion of Roman-Dutch law, English common law, and customary traditions shaped by its colonial past and diverse cultural fabric.
Portuguese rule (1505–1658) had minimal legal influence, focusing primarily on trade and religious conversion.
Dutch rule (1658–1796) entrenched Roman-Dutch law as the foundation for civil matters, including contracts, property, and torts.
British rule (1796–1948) introduced English criminal law through the Penal Code and commercial law via ordinances.
Post-independence in 1948, Sri Lanka retained this hybrid framework, weaving in customary laws such as Kandyan, Muslim, and Thesawalamai systems.
The Constitution of 1978, amended 19 times, stands as the supreme law, establishing a unitary state with a blended presidential-parliamentary governance model.
The judiciary comprises the Supreme Court (highest appellate authority), Court of Appeal, High Courts, District Courts, and Magistrate’s Courts.
Parliament, with 225 members elected every 5 years, serves as the primary legislative body.
The Attorney General’s Department prosecutes criminal cases and provides legal counsel to the government.
